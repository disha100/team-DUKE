# Food Heroes
We serve as a platform to feed the underpriveleged and people suffering from malnutrition, thereby utilising the resources appropriately and transferring the food to its required destination. We thus aim to provide an efficient chain system in order to reduce food wastage, and instead providing it to the rightful consumers.
## Our goals
* Journey to Zero Hunger
  ###### We aim to provide 100% access to adequate and healthy food to the underpriveleged all year round and eradicate hunger.
* Reduce food wastage
  ###### We aim to provide a strong distribution network that will help to eliminate the waste or loss of food.
